CQ2 is a tool for thoughtful and coherent discussions.

CQ2 is currently under heavy development, and if our passion for
thoughtful and coherent discussions resonates with you, we would
love to learn about your team, your frustrations with discussions
and better understand how CQ2 can help. [Get early access](https://tally.so/r/nGdzAO).

### Features

- **Quote-level**: Create organised, focused threads around any specific quote, as well as any specific message. No more copy-pasting quotes — just select the text and create a new thread. See which parts of the discussion became sub-discussions and which were overlooked.
- **N-level sliding panes**: Go as deep as needed with n-level sliding pane threads. See all the comments and parent threads of a specific sub-discussions in the same view.
- **Open-source**: Our source code is available on GitHub — feel free to read, review, or contribute to it. Optionally, run your own instance for greater control over your data and design.
- More features coming up in future!
